To install **Meowrch** on your **Arch Linux** VM, I will guide you through setting up **Arch Linux** first (in case you haven't already), and then how to clone and install **Meowrch** from the GitHub repository you shared.

### Steps to Set Up Arch Linux on a VM and Install Meowrch

#### **Step 1 — Set Up a Virtual Machine (VM) and Install Arch Linux**

1. **Download Arch Linux ISO**:
   - Download the latest Arch Linux ISO from [here](https://archlinux.org/download/).

2. **Create a VM**:
   - Use software like **VirtualBox** or **VMware** to create a VM.
   - Assign at least 2GB of **RAM** and **20GB of disk space**.
   - Mount the downloaded **Arch Linux ISO** as the bootable disk in your VM settings.

3. **Boot the VM**:
   - Start the VM, and it will boot from the Arch Linux ISO. You'll get a terminal interface.

#### **Step 2 — Installing Arch Linux**

1. **Connect to the internet** (if not already connected):
   - For **Ethernet**, it should auto-connect.
   - For **Wi-Fi**, use:

   ```bash
   iwctl
   station device_name connect your_wifi_network
   ```

2. **Partition the disk**:
   - Use `cgdisk`, `fdisk`, or `parted` to partition the disk.
   
   Example with `cgdisk`:
   
   ```bash
   cgdisk /dev/sda
   ```

3. **Format the partitions**:

   ```bash
   mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1  # root partition
   ```

   (If you created a **boot partition**, format it as well with `mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2`.)

4. **Mount the partitions**:

   ```bash
   mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
   mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot  # if you have a boot partition
   ```

5. **Install base packages**:

   ```bash
   pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware
   ```

6. **Generate the fstab**:

   ```bash
   genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
   ```

7. **Chroot into the new system**:

   ```bash
   arch-chroot /mnt
   ```

#### **Step 3 — Configure Arch Linux**

1. **Set the timezone**:

   ```bash
   ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Region/City /etc/localtime
   hwclock --systohc
   ```

2. **Set hostname**:

   ```bash
   echo "myarchvm" > /etc/hostname
   ```

3. **Locale settings**:
   
   Edit `/etc/locale.gen` and uncomment the lines for your preferred locale (e.g., `en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8`).

   Then run:

   ```bash
   locale-gen
   ```

   Set the locale:

   ```bash
   echo "LANG=en_US.UTF-8" > /etc/locale.conf
   ```

4. **Set root password**:

   ```bash
   passwd
   ```

5. **Install necessary packages**:

   ```bash
   pacman -S networkmanager grub git
   ```

6. **Enable NetworkManager**:

   ```bash
   systemctl enable NetworkManager
   ```

7. **Install and configure GRUB bootloader**:

   ```bash
   grub-install --target=i386-pc --recheck /dev/sda
   grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
   ```

---

#### **Step 4 — Finalize and Reboot**

1. **Exit chroot**:

   ```bash
   exit
   ```

2. **Unmount**:

   ```bash
   umount -R /mnt
   ```

3. **Reboot the system**:

   ```bash
   reboot
   ```

Make sure to **remove the ISO from the boot sequence** so that your VM boots into Arch Linux.

#### **Step 5 — Install Meowrch from GitHub**

Once your Arch Linux installation is running, here’s how to install **Meowrch** from GitHub:

1. **Install required dependencies**:

   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S git base-devel
   ```

2. **Clone the Meowrch repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/meowrch/meowrch.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Meowrch directory**:

   ```bash
   cd meowrch
   ```

4. **Build Meowrch**:

   If there is an **`install.sh`** or similar script:

   ```bash
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```

   If it requires building from source using `makepkg` (typical for Arch AUR packages):

   ```bash
   makepkg -si
   ```

   This will build and install Meowrch.

5. **Follow additional instructions from the README**: If there are any post-installation steps in the [Meowrch GitHub repo](https://github.com/meowrch/meowrch), be sure to follow them.

### **Final Notes**

- **Meowrch** might need extra configuration after installation (e.g., setting up environment variables, or installing additional dependencies). Check the [GitHub page](https://github.com/meowrch/meowrch) for instructions.
- Make sure **networking** is up and running with **NetworkManager** to ensure you can access the internet for downloading any required packages or dependencies.
